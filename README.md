# Customer-Churn-Prediction_Analytics
🔮 Customer Churn Prediction – Predictive Analytics Project
📌 Project Description

This project is developed as part of the Predictive Analytics academic curriculum and focuses on predicting customer churn using data-driven modeling techniques. The goal is to analyze historical customer data, identify churn patterns, and build predictive models that can accurately classify whether a customer is likely to churn.

The project follows the complete predictive analytics lifecycle, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and performance evaluation. The results are further interpreted using visualizations and metrics to support business decision-making.

🎯 Project Objectives

 -> Understand customer behavior through data analysis

 -> Identify key factors contributing to customer churn

 -> Apply predictive analytics techniques to build churn prediction models

 -> Evaluate and compare model performance using standard metrics

 -> Present insights in a clear and interpretable manner

📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of customer-level information including:

-> Demographic details

-> Service usage and subscription information

-> Billing and payment attributes

-> Churn indicator (target variable)

-> Data cleaning and transformation were performed to ensure quality and consistency before model training.
